Week-by-week View

- **first week(26/02-03/03)**
  1. Get basic understanding of the compiler project
  2. Review material on slide that relates to this project
  3. Try to finish work for other module(e.g. control report) in order to give time for compiler
     
  About 2 hours each day

- **second week(04/03-10/03)**
  1. work together to finish the basic features
  2. modify the context with help from TA and online resources
  3. start adding higher level features
 
  About 4 hours each day

- **third week(11/03-17/03)**
  1. work on medium and high level features
  2. join the code on the two branches of us each day
  3. debugging and testing with the .sh file
     
  whole day in library, almost everyday until 1 a.m.

- **fourth week(18/03-22/03)**
  1. continue to add features as much as we can
  2. improve the coding layout and add comments
  3. do the finial testing to avoid error like memory leakage
  4. check all the test case we done work well
 
  whole day in library, until 10 p.m.
